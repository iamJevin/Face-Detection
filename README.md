# Face-Detection
Face Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective Face detection method proposed by 
Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. 
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. 
It is then used to detect Face in other images.
